1)Data Collection
		the dataset is assumed to be organized into two folders: 'data/train' and 'data/val'.
		The 'data/train' folder should contain subdirectories for each class of waste items that the model should be able to recognize,
		and each subdirectory should contain images of waste items belonging to that class.
		Similarly, the 'data/val' folder should contain subdirectories for each class, and each subdirectory should contain validation images of waste items belonging to that class.
		Folders under the train and val -> "organic waste", "plastic waste", "paper waste", "glass waste"
