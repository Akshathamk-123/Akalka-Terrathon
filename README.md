# Akalka-Terrathon

Problem Statement:

India's Waste Crisis is a Mounting Disaster.
Confronting the Reality of Overflowing Landfills, Polluted Streets, and a Deteriorating Environment.
It's Time to Take Action, Implement Innovative Solutions, and Build a Sustainable Waste Management System for a Better Tomorrow.
Three things need to be our main concerns when discussing about trash.
1) Waste Segregation Issues- People are having difficulty segregating waste because they are unsure whether it is recyclable or not.
2) Garbage truck monitoring issues-It has been a long-standing problem in the city as vehicles do not cover areas for several days. 
						Most of the time, vehicles do not cover every lane in the city
3) Supply chain management-Businesses that fail to manage their waste will find their operations become less sustainable. 
				What’s more, other companies may not work with organisations that create excess waste, as this impacts their supply chain and values
4) Everything related to the problem is not contained in a single platform to ensure effective use. 





SOLUTION:

For the discussed above problem, introducing "Akalka-
								Tackling the Tri-Fold Challenge of Waste Management"

As a part of solution we as a team have put together sustainable solutions that can solve the major three issues listed.
1)Waste Segregation-Deep Learning Model of Waste segregation which will identify the type of waste i.e., Biodegradable, Non-Biodegradable (Sub class: Recyclable, Resuable).
2)Supply Chain-It currently allows stakeholders to add waste management details to the app, as well as create certifications that can be added to data.
							 A mobile companion app allows scanning QR codes placed on the actual products to see the data on-premise 
3)Garbage Truck Monitoring System is a role based system having three roles admin, driver and a citizen.
		The routes will be generated using our algorithm which follows the approach followed by CVRP algorithm.
		 Daily, routes will be generated taking into account the real time garbage level, capacity of vehicles, the distance between bins, etc. 
		G Maps API provides an efficient way and real time distances according to the traffic parameter for the inputs.
We also encapsulate all the three solutions into a single platform, making it much more efficient.
Join the movement towards a cleaner, greener future by addressing the pressing challenges of waste management. 
By working together, we can make a real difference in the fight against waste and its impact on our environment.
